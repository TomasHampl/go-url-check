# What is this?
This is a simple (really) app written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It's not particularly efficient code (perhaps), but it's not meant to be. It was written just as a hobby project to see if I'm able to write something in Go. It turns out that yes, I am - barely.

## Purpose
It's a simple CLI application meant to send a number of HTTP requests to destination.

## Help
App accepts several command line options, you can invoke the help with `--help` parameter.
